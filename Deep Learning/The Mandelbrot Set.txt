F(z) = Z^2 + C[Z(n)=Z(n-1)^2+C]. Add 0 as the initial z where C is a coplex number and keep iterating the answer.
When this is done, one of two cases can occur.
Case 1: The answer grows and tends to infinity.
Case 2: The the distance between the answers is bounded and it never goes beyond 2.

The Mandelbrot set is the set of complex numbers, C for which case 2 holds.
Everything in the Mandelbrot set has to be within distance 2 of the centre when plotted on a graph.
Everything inside the diagram is within the Mandelbrot set.
The values at the edges are such that anyslight change causes an unpredictable outcome in such a way that it can be in or out of the set,
